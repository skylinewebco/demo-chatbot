 * Demo Chatbot engine — by Skyline Web Co
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * ONE engine, many businesses. Each business is a config file in /configs.
 *
 * Install on ANY website (the config file is loaded automatically):
 *     <script src="chatbot.js" data-type="dental"></script>
 * or load the config yourself first:
 *     <script src="configs/restaurant.js"></script>
 *     <script src="chatbot.js"></script>
 *
 * New client? Copy a file in /configs, rename it, edit the data — done.
 * The widget renders inside a Shadow DOM, so the host website's CSS can't
 * break it. No API key, no dependencies.

       This widget uses local intent detection so it works with no API key.
       For the real version, send free-text questions to Claude — e.g. call
       it from respond() when nothing matched (the fallback / out-of-scope
       branches), or replace buildAnswer() entirely:

         const res = await fetch("https://YOUR-BACKEND/api/chat", {

         });
         const { reply } = await res.json();
         bot(esc(reply));

       The backend (never the browser — the API key must stay secret) calls:
         POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
         headers: x-api-key: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
